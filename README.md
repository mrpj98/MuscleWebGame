# MuscleWebGame

A webserver running on an arduino would take in a signal from an electrode placed on top of a bicep muscle. If flexed at the right time the web server would update to show an animation of a block jumping over an obstacle, essentially playing a dumbed down version of the chrome offline dinosaur game.
